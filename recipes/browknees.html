                <p>A browknee is crunchier and chewier than a cake. I had no idea that these existed until my aunt made them. I remember that we were talking in the kitchen while these were baking and we forgot about them. Well, yeah, they got burned, but I helped her by removing the top burned crust. Take this recipe with a pinch of salt as this is from my memory.</p>
